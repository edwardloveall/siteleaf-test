# Welcome to First Parish!

We warmly invite visitors to First Parish to look for the Welcome sign at coffee hour and join us at the tables set up there, where we will be pleased to talk with you. We can answer your questions, talk with you about ways you might want to get involved, and let you know about the path to membership in our community. You can also fill out a First Parish Connection Card, so that we can send you weekly announcements about First Parish activities. We look forward to getting to know you!

Services
Services are held every Sunday, starting at 10:00 am and running until 11:30 am. Following the service there is an informal "Coffee and Friendship Hour," which is an excellent time to meet and chat with other members of the congregation. Please visit our Worship Services page for more information.

A Welcoming Congregation
First Parish Church is a proud member of the UU Association's "Welcoming Congregation" program, which means we are committed to providing a warm and open environment to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people. For further information on this program please visit the UUA's Welcoming Congregation page.

Religious Education
First Parish has a vibrant Religious Education program. RE Director Tina Schultz works with a support team of paid staff and of volunteer teachers from within the congregation. Adult programs respond to congregational interests and are led by both professional staff and persons within the congregation.

Church Membership
Have you been coming to First Parish for a while now, and feel ready to take the next step? Contact the Membership Committee (membership@firstparish.info) about the process for becoming a church member. You will be asked to speak with our minister, and if you're new to Unitarian Universalism or to First Parish, you'll be encouraged to take the "New UU" course offered twice per year. Of course, signing the membership book implies a commitment to the basic principles of Unitarian Universalism, as well as to First Parish and the larger community here at First Parish. Please visit our Path to Membership page for more information.

Volunteer
Perhaps one of the best ways to become a part of the First Parish community is to volunteer: serve on one of our many committees, teach in our Religious Education program, help with Sunday services or other activities. Not only will you have the satisfaction of helping the community, but it's a great way to meet people with similar interests. For more information, visit our Volunteering section.
